        <h2>Kristen Lee</h2>
        <p>Hey there everyone! I have been married to my husband Bryan for almost 14 years and we have 4 amazing kids. I currently live in Baton Rouge, LA. We moved here 2 years ago from Orlando, FL and like it just fine, but miss all the fun things there are to do in FL.</p>
        <p>I am pursuing a degree in graphic design and web development and hope to be able to use those skills to create a business to make and sell downloadable content. I love to craft, spend time with my family, watch movies, and play games with my husband and kids.</p>
        <p>I am a homemaker and have been a member of the Church all my life. I love BYU-I because Christ is present in every class no matter the subject. I love that I get spiritual messages and connections to what I am learning everyday! I am taking this class to learn a new skill that can potentially help me grow a business. An added bonus is that my kids have shown interest in this subject, so I can pass my knowledge onto them :)</p>
