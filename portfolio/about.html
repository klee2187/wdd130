                    Hello! My name is Kristen Lee, and I’m a proud nerd with a passion for many fandoms. I’m also a stay-at-home mom to four amazing kids. As an aspiring Graphic and Web Designer, I’m excited to be graduating from Brigham Young University Idaho with a degree in Professional Studies, specializing in Graphic Design and Web Development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While I’m new to the professional side of design, I’ve been exploring various design techniques for years. Creativity has always been at the heart of what I do—I’ve loved experimenting with different materials since I was young, always looking for ways to transform the ordinary into something extraordinary. I’m passionate about learning new skills and expanding my knowledge. Digital design is my latest pursuit, and I absolutely love the artistic freedom it allows!
