      <h4>About the Designer</h4>
      <p>Welcome!</p>
      <p>My name is Kristen Lee. I am a huge nerd (I have many a fandom) and a stay-at-home mother of 4. I am an aspiring Graphic and Web Designer. I am graduating from Brigham Young University Idaho with a degree in Professional Studies with an emphasis in Graphic Design and Web Development. Although I am new to the professional aspect of design, I have had plenty of experience with all types of design over the years. Ever since I was young, I have been very creative and used almost any material I can get my hands on to create something new. I love taking something that appears to have little value and turning it into something amazing! I love to learn new trades and am constantly broadening my skillset. Digital Design is my most recent pursuit and I love the freedom that it provides artistic creativity.</p>
      <h4>Q & A</h4>
